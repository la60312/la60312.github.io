About me
===================
I am currently a Computer Science PhD student at Institute for Genomic Statistics and Bioinformatics at University of Bonn and under supervision of Prof. Peter Krawitz. I recieved bachelor and master degree in Computer Science at National Taiwan University. After my master, I worked at Garmin Corporation as a software engineer for almost two years.

I am interested in developing computational approaches to analyze patients in human genetics and currently working on project "Prioritization of Exome Data by Image Analysis" and "Gestalt Matcher" which is utilizing deep learning to analyze patient's facial images to diagnose rare Mendelian disorders. My research falls in machine learning, bioinformatics and genetics.
